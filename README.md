# Deep Learning

1. Deep learning -subset of ml     (Time is a reasonable tradeoff when compared to scope)
2. It is a type of  machine learning that works on the basis of the functionalities of a human brain.It trains machines to work on vast
volumes of structured and Unstrctured data.
Libraries: TensorFlow,Keras,Caffe,Theano etc.
## Neural Networks
3.Deep learning uses the concept of the neural networks derived from the structure of human brain where
                        -Dendrites   ---Inputs
                        -Cell Nucleus---Nodes
                        -Synapse     ---weights
                        -Axon        ---output

4.Layers: Input lAYER: Responsible to accept the inputs in various formats.
        Hidden layer: Responsible for extracting features and hidden patterns from data (inputs)
        output layer: Produces the desired output after completing the entire processing of data. 

5.activation function:*Sigmoid Function, threshold function,Relu function,Hyperbolic Tangent Function

6.COST FUNCTION:mesures the accuracy of the network,computes the error between the actual and predicted output.
** Error in the network is calculated by cost function and improved with backward Propagation.

7.Epoch :It represents the number of times the neural network has seen and processed the entire training dataset.      

8.Forward Propagation: A Trained neural network with multiple weights on each neuron with the activation function gives a particluar output.

9.Backward Propagation: Once the neural network is trained and the output is predicted with forward Propagation it thens calculates the 
   error and the compute the magnitude of the error and send the inforamtion back to adjust weights with the respective neuron to predict
   or to get the better accuracy.

-Applications: Face recognition,Forecasting,Music composition etc.
-Types of Neural Networks: GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks),DBN(Deep Belief Networks),RBFN(Radial Basis Function Networks),
Autoencoder,RNN(Recurrent Neural Networks),LSTM(Long Short-Term Memory Networks),CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks)
